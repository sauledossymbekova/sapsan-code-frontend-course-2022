      <i>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy</i>
      <strong>text of the printing</strong> and typesetting industry. Lorem
      Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
      when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
      type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
      leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
      popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
      Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
      like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
